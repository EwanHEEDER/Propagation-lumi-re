# Propagation-lumiere

This project has been held by Ewan HEEDER and Sugeiva KISNAPAVAN for the Numerical Physics course of Sorbonne Universit√© Bachelor's degree in Physics

This programm uses numerical resolution of eikonal equations in order to recreate the propagation of a light ray in different materials.

It requires to define the refraction index of the medium by a function, which for exemple can be constant, position-dependant, wavelength-dependant ...
